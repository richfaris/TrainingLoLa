# BriteCore SQL Editor Training Course Overview üìö

## üéØ Course Mission

This specialized course teaches you how to access and analyze BriteCore Application data using SQL and modern database tools. Unlike traditional SQL courses that use generic sample databases, this course focuses on real insurance industry data through BriteCore's logical layer views.

## üèóÔ∏è Course Architecture

### The BriteCore Advantage
- **Over 40 pre-built business views and several financial measure views**: No need to understand complex table relationships
- **Business-Friendly Names**: Field names that make sense to insurance professionals
- **Optimized Performance**: Views are tuned for common query patterns
- **Real Data**: Work with actual insurance business scenarios

### View Categories
- **v_ Views**: Standard business views (e.g., v_contacts, v_claims, v_properties, v_policy_types, v_payments, v_commission_details, v_revisions, v_revision_items, etc.)
- **m_ Views**: Measure views for financial and premium analysis (e.g., m_accounting_terms, m_premium_terms, m_premium_transactions, m_inforce_policies)
Some m_ views are materialized, which increases system performance.
- **Logical Layer**: All views are part of BriteCore's logical layer architecture, designed for business-friendly querying
