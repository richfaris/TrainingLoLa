## üéØ Common Query Patterns

### 1. **Basic Data Retrieval**
```sql
SELECT [fields] FROM [view] WHERE [conditions];
```

### 2. **Aggregations**
```sql
SELECT [group_field], COUNT(*), SUM([numeric_field])
FROM [view]
GROUP BY [group_field];
```

### 3. **Date Filtering**
```sql
SELECT * FROM [view]
WHERE [date_field] BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

### 4. **Text Search**
```sql
SELECT * FROM [view]
WHERE [text_field] LIKE '%search_term%';
```

### 5. **Joining Views**
```sql
SELECT c.contact_name, cl.claim_number
FROM v_contacts c
JOIN v_claims cl ON c.contact_id = cl.contact_id;
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Always use LIMIT** when exploring data
2. **Check for NULL values** in important fields
3. **Use appropriate date formats** (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. **Test queries on small datasets** first
5. **Use meaningful field aliases** for clarity

## üîç Performance Tips

- Views are optimized for common query patterns
- Use indexed fields in WHERE clauses when possible
- Avoid SELECT * in production queries
- Use appropriate data types for comparisons
