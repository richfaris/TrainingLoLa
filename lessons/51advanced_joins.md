## üîó Understanding View Relationships

BriteCore views are designed to work together. Understanding their relationships is key to advanced analysis.

### Common JOIN Patterns

| Primary View | Related View | Join Field | Business Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| `v_claims` | `v_policy_types` | `policy_type_id` | Claims by policy type |
| `v_claims` | `v_contacts` | `contact_id` | Claims by insured |
| `v_payments` | `v_policy_types` | `policy_type_id` | Payments by policy type |
| `v_properties` | `v_policy_types` | `policy_type_id` | Properties by policy type |
| `v_commission_details` | `v_contacts` | `agent_id` | Commissions by agent |

## üîç Basic Multi-View JOINs

### 1. Claims with Policy and Contact Information
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_number,
    c.claim_status,
    c.loss_date,
    pt.policy_type_name,
    con.contact_name as insured_name
FROM v_claims c
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON c.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
JOIN v_contacts con ON c.primary_insured_id = con.contact_id
WHERE c.claim_active_flag =1DER BY c.loss_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Payments with Policy and Contact Details
```sql
SELECT 
    p.payment_amount,
    p.payment_date,
    p.payment_method,
    pt.policy_type_name,
    con.contact_name as policyholder
FROM v_payments p
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON p.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
JOIN v_contacts con ON p.primary_insured_id = con.contact_id
WHERE p.payment_status =completed
ORDER BY p.payment_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üè¢ Complex Business Analysis

### Claims Analysis by Agent and Policy Type
```sql
SELECT 
    agent.contact_name as agent_name,
    pt.policy_type_name,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) as claim_count,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(c.date_reported, c.loss_date)) as avg_reporting_delay
FROM v_claims c
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON c.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
JOIN v_contacts agent ON c.agent_id = agent.contact_id
WHERE c.claim_active_flag = 1
  AND agent.roles LIKE %agent%'
GROUP BY agent.contact_name, pt.policy_type_name
ORDER BY claim_count DESC;
```

### Financial Performance by Agent
```sql
SELECT 
    agent.contact_name as agent_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.policy_number) as policy_count,
    SUM(p.payment_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(p.payment_amount) as avg_payment,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) as claim_count
FROM v_payments p
JOIN v_contacts agent ON p.agent_id = agent.contact_id
LEFT JOIN v_claims c ON p.policy_number = c.policy_number
WHERE p.payment_status =completed'
  AND agent.roles LIKE %agent%'
GROUP BY agent.contact_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## üìä Advanced Aggregations

### Policy Portfolio Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    pt.policy_type_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) as policy_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) as claim_count,
    SUM(p.payment_amount) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) * 100as claim_frequency
FROM v_policy_types pt
LEFT JOIN v_revisions r ON pt.policy_type_id = r.policy_type_id
LEFT JOIN v_claims c ON r.revision_id = c.revision_id
LEFT JOIN v_payments p ON r.policy_number = p.policy_number
WHERE pt.active =1D p.payment_status =completed'
GROUP BY pt.policy_type_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Geographic Risk Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(prop.address_city,,, 1)as city,
    COUNT(DISTINCT prop.property_id) as property_count,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) as claim_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.claim_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT prop.property_id) * 100,2as claim_rate
FROM v_properties prop
LEFT JOIN v_claims c ON prop.property_id = c.loss_address_id
WHERE prop.address_city IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY SUBSTRING_INDEX(prop.address_city, ',', 1ING property_count > 5
ORDER BY claim_rate DESC;
```

## üéØ Business Intelligence Dashboards

### Executive Summary Dashboard
```sql
SELECT 'Total Policies' as metric,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) as value
FROM v_revisions r
WHERE r.active =1UNION ALL
SELECTActive Claims',
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id)
FROM v_claims c
WHERE c.claim_active_flag =1UNION ALL
SELECTTotal Revenue',
    SUM(p.payment_amount)
FROM v_payments p
WHERE p.payment_status =completedUNION ALL
SELECTActive Agents',
    COUNT(DISTINCT con.contact_id)
FROM v_contacts con
WHERE con.roles LIKE%agent%' AND con.deleted =0UNION ALL
SELECT 'Properties Insured',
    COUNT(DISTINCT prop.property_id)
FROM v_properties prop
WHERE prop.active =1 Agent Performance Dashboard
```sql
SELECT 
    agent.contact_name as agent_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) as policies_written,
    SUM(p.payment_amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) as claims_handled,
    ROUND(SUM(cd.commission_amount), 2) as total_commission
FROM v_contacts agent
LEFT JOIN v_revisions r ON agent.contact_id = r.agent_id
LEFT JOIN v_payments p ON r.policy_number = p.policy_number
LEFT JOIN v_claims c ON r.revision_id = c.revision_id
LEFT JOIN v_commission_details cd ON agent.contact_id = cd.agent_id
WHERE agent.roles LIKE '%agent%' 
  AND agent.deleted =0D p.payment_status =completed'
GROUP BY agent.contact_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## üí° JOIN Best Practices

### 1e Appropriate JOIN Types**
- `INNER JOIN`: When you need matching records from both tables
- `LEFT JOIN`: When you want all records from the left table
- `RIGHT JOIN`: When you want all records from the right table

### 2**Optimize JOIN Order**
```sql
-- Good: Start with the most filtered table
FROM v_claims c
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON c.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
WHERE c.claim_active_flag = 1

-- Better: Apply filters early
FROM v_claims c
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON c.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
WHERE c.claim_active_flag = 1 AND pt.active =1

### 3**Use Table Aliases**
```sql
FROM v_claims c
JOIN v_policy_types pt ON c.policy_type_id = pt.policy_type_id
JOIN v_contacts con ON c.primary_insured_id = con.contact_id
```
This makes queries more readable and maintainable.

### 4**Handle NULL Values**
```sql
WHERE c.loss_cause IS NOT NULL
```
Many fields can be NULL, affecting your JOIN results.

## üìù Practice Questions

1w would you create a report showing claims by agent and policy type?**
2. **What's the relationship between payments and claims for each policy type?**
3. **How do you calculate agent performance including policies, claims, and revenue?**
4. **Which geographic areas have the highest claim rates?**

## üîó Next Steps

In the next lesson, well explore window functions for trend analysis, including:
- Running totals and moving averages
- Rank and percentile calculations
- Time-series analysis
- Advanced statistical functions

**üí° Pro Tip**: Complex JOINs can be resource-intensive. Always test with LIMIT clauses first, and consider breaking complex queries into smaller, more manageable pieces.
