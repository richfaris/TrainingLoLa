## üìä Understanding Window Functions

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. They're powerful for trend analysis and statistical calculations.

### Basic Window Function Syntax
```sql
SELECT 
    column1,
    column2,
    window_function() OVER (
        PARTITION BY partition_column 
        ORDER BY order_column
        ROWS/RANGE frame_specification
    ) as result_column
FROM table_name;
```

## üî¢ Running Totals and Cumulative Analysis

### Running Total of Payments
```sql
SELECT 
    payment_date,
    payment_amount,
    SUM(payment_amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY payment_date 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_total
FROM v_payments
WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY payment_date;
```

### Monthly Running Revenue
```sql
WITH monthly_data AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m') as payment_month,
        SUM(payment_amount) as monthly_revenue
    FROM v_payments
    WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    payment_month,
    monthly_revenue,
    SUM(monthly_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY payment_month
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as cumulative_revenue
FROM monthly_data
ORDER BY payment_month;
```

### Agent Commission Running Totals
```sql
SELECT 
    con.contact_name as agent_name,
    commission_date,
    commission_amount,
    SUM(commission_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY con.contact_name
        ORDER BY commission_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as agent_running_total
FROM v_commission_details cd
JOIN v_contacts con ON cd.agent_id = con.contact_id
WHERE cd.commission_status = 'paid'
ORDER BY con.contact_name, commission_date;
```

## üìà Moving Averages and Trends

### 3-Month Moving Average of Claims
```sql
WITH monthly_claims AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(loss_date, '%Y-%m') as loss_month,
        COUNT(*) as claim_count
    FROM v_claims
    WHERE claim_active_flag = 1 AND loss_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(loss_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    loss_month,
    claim_count,
    AVG(claim_count) OVER (
        ORDER BY loss_month
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as moving_avg_3months
FROM monthly_claims
ORDER BY loss_month;
```

### 12-Month Moving Average of Revenue
```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m') as payment_month,
        SUM(payment_amount) as monthly_revenue
    FROM v_payments
    WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    payment_month,
    monthly_revenue,
    AVG(monthly_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY payment_month
        ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as moving_avg_12months
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY payment_month;
```

## üèÜ Ranking and Percentile Analysis

### Agent Performance Rankings
```sql
SELECT 
    con.contact_name as agent_name,
    SUM(cd.commission_amount) as total_commission,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(cd.commission_amount) DESC) as rank_by_commission,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(cd.commission_amount) DESC) as dense_rank_by_commission,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(cd.commission_amount) DESC) as row_number_by_commission
FROM v_commission_details cd
JOIN v_contacts con ON cd.agent_id = con.contact_id
WHERE cd.commission_status = 'paid'
GROUP BY con.contact_name
ORDER BY total_commission DESC;
```

### Policy Type Performance Percentiles
```sql
SELECT 
    pt.policy_type_name,
    COUNT(r.revision_id) as policy_count,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(r.revision_id) DESC) as performance_quartile,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(r.revision_id) DESC) as percentile_rank
FROM v_policy_types pt
LEFT JOIN v_revisions r ON pt.policy_type_id = r.policy_type_id
WHERE pt.active = 1
GROUP BY pt.policy_type_name
ORDER BY policy_count DESC;
```

## üìä Advanced Statistical Analysis

### Claims by Loss Cause with Percentiles
```sql
SELECT 
    loss_cause,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as percentile_rank,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as cumulative_distribution
FROM v_claims
WHERE claim_active_flag = 1 AND loss_cause IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY loss_cause
ORDER BY claim_count DESC;
```

### Payment Amount Distribution Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    payment_amount,
    COUNT(*) as payment_count,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY payment_amount) as amount_percentile,
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY payment_amount) as decile
FROM v_payments
WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY payment_amount;
```

## üéØ Time-Series Analysis

### Month-over-Month Growth
```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m') as payment_month,
        SUM(payment_amount) as monthly_revenue
    FROM v_payments
    WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    payment_month,
    monthly_revenue,
    LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY payment_month) as prev_month_revenue,
    ROUND(
        (monthly_revenue - LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY payment_month)) / 
        LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY payment_month) * 100, 2) as growth_percentage
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY payment_month;
```

### Claims Trend Analysis
```sql
WITH monthly_claims AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(loss_date, '%Y-%m') as loss_month,
        COUNT(*) as claim_count
    FROM v_claims
    WHERE claim_active_flag = 1 AND loss_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(loss_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    loss_month,
    claim_count,
    LAG(claim_count) OVER (ORDER BY loss_month) as prev_month_claims,
    LEAD(claim_count) OVER (ORDER BY loss_month) as next_month_claims
FROM monthly_claims
ORDER BY loss_month;
```

## üè¢ Business Intelligence with Window Functions

### Agent Performance with Rankings
```sql
SELECT 
    con.contact_name as agent_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) as policies_written,
    SUM(p.payment_amount) as total_revenue,
    SUM(cd.commission_amount) as total_commission,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.payment_amount) DESC) as revenue_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(cd.commission_amount) DESC) as commission_rank,
    ROUND(SUM(cd.commission_amount) / SUM(p.payment_amount) * 100, 2) as commission_percentage
FROM v_contacts con
LEFT JOIN v_revisions r ON con.contact_id = r.agent_id
LEFT JOIN v_payments p ON r.policy_number = p.policy_number
LEFT JOIN v_commission_details cd ON con.contact_id = cd.agent_id
WHERE con.roles LIKE '%agent%' 
  AND con.deleted = 0
  AND p.payment_status = 'completed'
  AND cd.commission_status = 'paid'
GROUP BY con.contact_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Policy Type Profitability Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    pt.policy_type_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) as policy_count,
    SUM(p.payment_amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) as claim_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.claim_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT r.revision_id) * 100, 2) as claim_frequency,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.payment_amount) DESC) as revenue_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(c.claim_id) DESC) as claim_rank
FROM v_policy_types pt
LEFT JOIN v_revisions r ON pt.policy_type_id = r.policy_type_id
LEFT JOIN v_payments p ON r.policy_number = p.policy_number
LEFT JOIN v_claims c ON r.revision_id = c.revision_id
WHERE pt.active = 1
  AND p.payment_status = 'completed'
GROUP BY pt.policy_type_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## üí° Window Function Best Practices

### 1**Choose Appropriate Window Frame**
```sql
-- For running totals
ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

-- For moving averages
ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

-- For specific ranges
RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 30 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

### 2**Use PARTITION BY for Grouped Analysis**
```sql
PARTITION BY agent_id ORDER BY commission_date
```
This creates separate calculations for each agent.

### 3**Consider Performance with Large Datasets**
```sql
-- Limit the window frame for better performance
ROWS BETWEEN 12 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

### 4**Combine with Other Aggregations**
```sql
SUM(SUM(payment_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY month)
```
Use nested aggregations for complex calculations.
