# I need the dollar value and number of transactions by customer paid on:
# Return premiums
# Commissions
# Claims
# Ideally, if I could get a spreadsheet of all payments showing for a period of 12 months, that would do the trick:
# Customer Name | Date Time | Payout Type | Payee | Payee Type (optional) | Amount
# Payout Type = return premium, commission or claims
# Payee Type = agency, insured, claimant/loss payee, claims legal payee, claims adjusting payee, etc.
#
